Research conducted by doctoral students at different Ugandan universities
shows that students and professors are in need of psychological aid and
support.  Over the past years Uganda has seen an increase in suicides and
violence. During our contacts with Nkumba University in Entebbe we were
confronted with the size and consequences of psychological suffering and
emotional needs with little or no easily accessible aid or support at hand.
There is a lack of qualified counsellors, knowhow and an adequate
psychological health care offer in schools and universities to meet these
psychological and emotional needs. Students and professors face family
problems, harsh home situations, sexual problems, emotional problems and
health problems (HIV/Aids) and are calling for help.

We are convinced we can make a difference and that is why, in 2011 together
with Nkumba University, we created the non-profit organisation Munnange
which means "my friend" in Luganda, one of the widely spread spoken
languages in Uganda.

# Mission and vision
Munnange thinks with an open mind with respect for each individual, regardless
of identity, religion or colour.

We personally find it unacceptable to live in a world where intelligent and
motivated students and professors who want to contribute to the development and
progress of their country do not get the chance to do so because they are
constantly preoccupied with worries, personal problems and/or tension in the
family.

We want to give Ugandan students and professors at Nkumba University in
Entebbe, but also the wider communities, the chance to call upon qualified and
independent counsellors who can listen to their stories, give them professional
counselling, refer them to other aid organisations or simply give them the time
and space to find some peace and quiet.

Together with Vives-Ipsoc we organise guest lectures and workshops at Nkumba
University to exhange knowledge and expertise. By doing so Munnagne wants to
improve the quality of education as corner stone for a solid society.

<p>Munnange starts from peopleâ€™s own strengths, i.e. we want to reinforce the
competences that already exist. A society can become much stronger based on
knowledge rather than on pure charity or material aid.</p>
<h1>Our goals</h1>
<p>
	Munnange wants to focus on structural rather than individual changes, to meet
	holistic rather than individual needs and therefore focuses on the coal to
	build and manage psychological counselling in Uganda:<br>
	<ol>
 <li>Munnange	Counselling Centre, a psychological health care centre on the campus of Nkumba
	University:<br>
  The Munnange Counselling Centre was officially opened in
	April 2012 and since October 2013 we employ three parttime Ugandan counsellors,
	i.e. Michael, Jamilah and Abdu. Today we mainly offer psychological care and
	support to students and professors of the university but we make sure that it
	is also easily accessible to the wider communities (out-reaching). </li>
<li>Outreach work:<br>
<img src="MyImages/IMG_5481.jpg" style="float:right;">
Since we started we regularly were approached by external organisations or
schools in the neighbourhood of Nkumba University with the request to organise
counselling sessions for their target groups. After much deliberation we finally
set up an intense partnership with Early Learning School and St Noah Secondary
School. </br>
Early Learning School is a shelter and school for orphans, for children whose
parents are in prison or whose parents have abandoned them. Munnange organises
both individual and group counselling for them. The children and youngsters
indicate that these counselling talks give them strength and make daily life a
little more bearable. </br>
St Noah Secondary School works mainly with children and youngsters from fishing
families. These families are often torn apart because of alcohol abuse, violence
and lack of parental commitment. The management of St Noah regularly refers
children to Munnange Counselling Centre and contacts our counsellors to mediate
and support them in crisis situations at school. </br>

<li>Satellite Office at Kisubi Hospital: <br>
<img src="MyImages/IMG_6525.jpg" style="float:left;">
In October 2013 we also opened our first satellite office at Kisubi hospital,
some 5km from the Nkumba University campus. We accepted the proposal of Dr
Robert to detach a Munnange counsellor to the hosptial to provide counselling
both to ambulant and residential patients. We are extremely happy with this big
step because this way we embed ourselves in existing healthcare organisations
which helps us to secure our long-term existence. </br>
</li>
</ol>

It is noticeable that there is a need for counselling in Uganda. We  hope to
expand the outreach work in the future. In cooperation with VIVES University,
located in Belgium, we try to exchange knowledge and expertise by means of
guest lectures, workshops and conferences at Nkumba University to strengthen
the course "psychological guidance and counselling"  which in future will lead
to a broad social and professional network and to better qualified counsellors.
We also organise international internships with students form VIVES
University.
